# Docker Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive Docker documentation repository. This collection provides in-depth knowledge about Docker containerization technology, covering everything from basics to advanced concepts.

## Contents

### 1. [Docker Interview Questions](./Docker-Interview-Questions.md)
A comprehensive guide covering:
- Docker fundamentals (containers, images, Dockerfile)
- Essential Docker commands
- Docker networking concepts and configurations
- Docker volumes and data persistence
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Dockerfile best practices and optimization
- Multi-stage builds for efficient images
- Docker security considerations
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Real-world scenarios and use cases

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. It packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can run consistently across different environments.

## Key Benefits

- **Portability**: Run containers anywhere - on your laptop, in a data center, or in the cloud
- **Consistency**: Eliminate "works on my machine" problems
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight
- **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications horizontally
- **Speed**: Fast startup times compared to virtual machines

## Core Concepts

### Containers
Lightweight, standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software.

### Images
Read-only templates used to create containers. Built from Dockerfiles.

### Dockerfile
A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

### Docker Compose
A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Docker Registry
A storage and distribution system for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

## Getting Started

### Installation
Visit the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to download and install Docker for your operating system.

### Verify Installation
```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

## Quick Reference

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull <image-name>

# Run a container
docker run <image-name>

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop <container-id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container-id>
```

## Learning Path

1. Start with Docker basics and understand containers vs VMs
2. Learn to write Dockerfiles and build images
3. Explore Docker networking and volumes
4. Master Docker Compose for multi-container apps
5. Study security best practices
6. Practice with real-world scenarios
