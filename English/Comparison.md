## When to Use Each

### Use Docker When:

✅ **Suitable Scenarios:**

#### 1. Development Environment
```bash
# Developer wants to run MySQL locally
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
  mysql:latest

# Quick and easy!
```

#### 2. Simple Single Application
```bash
# Simple web app
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

#### 3. Testing
```bash
# Test app in isolated environment
docker run --rm myapp:test npm test
```

#### 4. Small Microservices (Docker Compose)
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: redis
  db:
    image: postgres
```

**Summary: Use Docker for:**
- 👨‍💻 Development
- 🧪 Testing
- 🏠 Small local applications
- 📦 Single server deployments

---

### Use Kubernetes When:

✅ **Suitable Scenarios:**

#### 1. Microservices in Production
```yaml
# 10 microservices, each with 3 replicas
# Manual management is impossible
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3  # K8s manages 3 copies automatically
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: user-service:v1
```

#### 2. High Availability
```yaml
# If pod crashes, K8s creates new one automatically
# If node fails, K8s moves pods to another node
```

#### 3. Auto-Scaling
```yaml
# Automatically scale based on load
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myapp-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    name: myapp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

#### 4. Multi-Cloud/Hybrid Cloud
```yaml
# Same application works on:
# - AWS
# - Google Cloud
# - On-Premise
# Without changes
```

**Summary: Use Kubernetes for:**
- 🏭 Production environments
- 📈 Applications needing scaling
- 🔄 High availability
- ☁️ Multi-cloud
- 🏗️ Microservices architecture

3. Push to registry
4. Write Deployment YAML
5. Apply YAML

# In OpenShift (one step):
oc new-app nodejs~https://github.com/user/my-app
# ✅ Done!
```

#### 3. Advanced Security
```
OpenShift Security:
✅ SELinux
✅ Security Context Constraints (SCC)
✅ Default network policies
✅ Image scanning
✅ Advanced RBAC
```

#### 4. Integrated CI/CD

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Simple Application

#### With Docker:
```bash
# Dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]

# Build and run
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
```
**✅ Suitable:** development, testing, demo

#### With Kubernetes:
```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
---
# service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
**✅ Suitable:** production, scaling, high availability

#### With OpenShift:

# Method 1: S2I (Easiest)
oc new-app nodejs~https://github.com/user/myapp
oc expose service myapp

# Method 2: From Image
oc new-app myapp:latest
oc expose service myapp

# Web Console also available!
```
**✅ Suitable:** enterprise, developer-friendly, managed

---

### Example 2: E-Commerce Application

#### Architecture:
```
E-Commerce App:
├── Frontend (React)
├── Backend API (Node.js)
├── User Service (Java)
├── Product Service (Python)
├── Order Service (Go)
├── Payment Service (Node.js)
├── Database (PostgreSQL)
└── Cache (Redis)
```

#### With Docker Compose (Development):
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret

  redis:
    image: redis
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```
**✅ Suitable:** local development

#### With Kubernetes (Production):
```yaml
# Each service has:
# - Deployment (with replicas)
# - Service (load balancing)
# - ConfigMap (configuration)
# - Secret (passwords)
# - PersistentVolume (database)
# - HorizontalPodAutoscaler (scaling)

# Example: Backend Service
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  replicas: 5
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: backend:v1
        env:
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-secret
              key: password
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
  - port: 5000
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Auto-scaling per service
- ✅ High availability
- ✅ Rolling updates without downtime
- ✅ Self-healing

#### With OpenShift (Enterprise Production):
```bash
# Same as K8s + additional features:

# 1. Web Console for management
# 2. S2I for quick deployment
oc new-app nodejs~https://github.com/company/backend

# 3. Integrated CI/CD Pipeline
oc create -f pipeline.yaml

# 4. Automatic routes
oc expose service backend
# Route: backend-myproject.apps.openshift.com

# 5. Integrated monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
# 6. Integrated logging (EFK Stack)
# 7. Advanced security
```

**Additional Benefits:**
- ✅ Developer-friendly
- ✅ Integrated monitoring
- ✅ Advanced security
- ✅ Commercial support

## Key Differences

### 1. Level and Purpose

```
Docker:          Container Runtime
                 ↓
Kubernetes:      Container Orchestration
                 ↓
OpenShift:       Enterprise Platform
```

**Analogy:**
- **Docker** = One car
- **Kubernetes** = Fleet of cars with management system
- **OpenShift** = Enterprise transport company with drivers, support, and maintenance

---

### 2. Networking

#### Docker:
```bash
# Simple network
docker network create mynetwork
docker run --network=mynetwork app1
docker run --network=mynetwork app2
```

#### Kubernetes:
```yaml
# Advanced networking
# Each pod has IP
# Services for load balancing
# Network Policies for security
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

#### OpenShift:
```yaml
# Same as K8s + advanced SDN
# Multi-tenant networking
# Default network isolation between Projects
```

---

### 3. Security

#### Docker:
```bash
# Basic security
docker run --user 1000 myapp
docker run --read-only myapp
```

#### Kubernetes:
```yaml
# Medium security
# RBAC
# Pod Security Policies
# Network Policies
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: myapp-sa
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

#### OpenShift:
```yaml
# Very advanced security
# SELinux
# Security Context Constraints (SCC)
# Strong multi-tenancy
# Integrated image scanning
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  name: restricted
# More restrictive than K8s
```

---

### 4. Developer Experience

#### Docker:
```bash
# Simple and direct
docker build -t myapp .
docker run myapp
```
**DX: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (for simple apps)**

#### Kubernetes:
```bash
# Complex
1. Write Dockerfile
2. Build image
3. Push to registry
4. Write 10+ YAML files
5. kubectl apply -f .
```
**DX: ⭐⭐ (steep learning curve)**

#### OpenShift:
```bash
# Very easy
oc new-app https://github.com/user/myapp
# ✅ Done!

# Or Web Console:
# Click → Select Git Repo → Deploy
```
**DX: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (easier than K8s)**

---

### 5. Cost

#### Docker:
```
💰 Completely free
```

#### Kubernetes:
