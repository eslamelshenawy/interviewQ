# CI/CD Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive guide covers Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) concepts, tools, and best practices for modern software development.

## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. Each integration is verified by automated builds and tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to production.

## Key Benefits

- **Faster Release Cycles**: Automate the entire software release process
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch issues early in the development cycle
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing and quality checks
- **Reduced Manual Errors**: Automation eliminates human mistakes
- **Better Collaboration**: Teams work on integrated codebase
- **Faster Time to Market**: Quick deployment of features and fixes

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

A typical CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

### 1. Source Stage
- Code commit triggers the pipeline
- Version control systems (Git, SVN)
- Webhook integration

### 2. Build Stage
- Compile source code
- Dependency resolution
- Generate artifacts
- Build Docker images

### 3. Test Stage
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning

### 4. Quality Analysis Stage
- Static code analysis
- Code coverage reports
- Security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks

### 5. Deploy Stage
- **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to test environment
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production
- **Database Migrations**: Update database schema
- **Configuration Updates**: Environment-specific configs

### 6. Monitor Stage
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Log aggregation
- Alert management

## Popular CI/CD Tools

### 1. Jenkins
- Open-source automation server
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile)
- Master-slave architecture

### 2. GitLab CI/CD
- Integrated with GitLab
- YAML-based configuration
- Built-in container registry
- Auto DevOps features

### 3. GitHub Actions
- Native GitHub integration
- Marketplace for actions
- Matrix builds
- Self-hosted runners

### 4. CircleCI
- Cloud-based CI/CD
- Docker support
- Workflow orchestration
- Performance insights

### 5. Travis CI
- Cloud-based platform
- Easy GitHub integration
- Multi-language support
- Build matrix

### 6. Azure DevOps
- Microsoft's DevOps platform
- Azure Pipelines
- Integrated project management
- Artifact management

## Key Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Terraform
- CloudFormation
- Ansible
- Puppet/Chef

### Containerization
- Docker
- Container registries (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR)
- Image optimization
- Multi-stage builds

### Orchestration
- Kubernetes
- Docker Swarm
- Amazon ECS
- Helm charts

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- Two identical production environments
- Switch traffic between blue and green
- Instant rollback capability
- Zero downtime deployment

#### Canary Deployment
- Gradual rollout to subset of users
- Monitor metrics before full rollout
- Risk mitigation
- A/B testing capability

#### Rolling Deployment
- Gradual replacement of instances
- Maintains availability
- Slower rollout
- Easy rollback

#### Recreate Deployment
- Stop old version completely
- Deploy new version
- Simple but has downtime
- Used for non-critical apps

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Branch protection rules
- Code review process
- Semantic versioning

### 2. Automated Testing
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Fast feedback loops
- Parallel test execution
- Test data management

### 3. Security
- Secret management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Dependency scanning
- Container scanning
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Centralized logging (ELK Stack, Splunk)
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Distributed tracing
- Alerting and notifications

### 5. Artifact Management
- Version artifacts
- Artifact repositories (Nexus, Artifactory)
- Immutable artifacts
- Retention policies

### 6. Pipeline Optimization
- Parallel execution
- Caching dependencies
- Incremental builds
- Pipeline templates
