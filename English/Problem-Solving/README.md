# Problem Solving Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and implementations of common problem-solving patterns and interview questions in computer science. All solutions are implemented in Java with detailed explanations.

## Contents

### 1. Problem-Solving Interview Questions
The main documentation covers essential topics and patterns frequently encountered in technical interviews:

- **Arrays and Strings**: Manipulation, searching, and pattern matching
- **Linked Lists**: Traversal, reversal, and cycle detection
- **Stacks and Queues**: LIFO/FIFO operations and applications
- **Trees**: Binary trees, BST operations, and traversals
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Comparison-based and efficient sorting methods
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search and variations
- **Recursion and Dynamic Programming**: Problem decomposition and optimization
- **Hash Tables**: Fast lookup and collision handling
- **Two Pointers and Sliding Window**: Efficient array/string processing
- **Big O Notation**: Time and space complexity analysis

## Purpose

This documentation serves as:
- A study guide for technical interviews
- A reference for common algorithms and data structures
- A collection of practical problem-solving patterns
- A resource for understanding algorithmic complexity

## How to Use

1. Start with the basics (Arrays, Strings) if you're new to problem solving
2. Progress through topics based on your learning goals
3. Study the code implementations and explanations
4. Practice writing the solutions yourself
5. Analyze the time and space complexity of each solution

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Java programming
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts
- Basic knowledge of data structures

## Getting Started
